# StockSummer
Summing stocks in Excel with VBA code.

## Description
- The topic is to summarize stock data for various years, and then to search for the greatest % increases/decreases in stock price and greatest stock volume traded.
 - The main raw data file is found in "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx", however at this time it is to large to upload to Github.
 - A smaller data set is given in "alphabtical_testing.xlsx", to ease building the script, and can be uploaded.
 - A version of the smaller data set, "alphabtical_testing.xlsm" was used to build the script with macros enabled.
 - Two versions, "alphabetical_testing_test.xlsm" and "Multiple_year_stock_data_to_run.xlsm" were created to run the final script, so the results may be seen, while saving the raw data in other files.  Again, the full data set is currently to large to upload to github.  
 - The "alphabtical_testing_test.xlsm" file has the results of the most difficult requirements run on it.
 - However, screenshots for the final results of each year for the large data set are included, as "2014 Screenshot Hard.png", "2015 Screenshot Hard.png", and "2014 Screenshot Hard.png", for the final project, and corresponding ones for the less difficult checkpoints on the way ("2016 Screenshot Medium.png", "2015 Screenshot Medium.png", "2014 Screenshot Medium.png", "2016 Screenshot Easy.png", "2015 Screenshot Easy.png", and "2014 Screenshot Easy.png"
- Also the macro, "StockSummer", is saved as a separate vbs file for all cases ("StockSummerHard.vbs", "StockSummerMedium.vbs", and "StockSummerEasy.vbs".
